# Slash

![Travis Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/slash-lang/slash.png)

Slash is a new language for the web. It's designed for the cases when you just want to throw up a simple dynamic page and don't want to have to bother setting up and maintaining application servers.

It's inspired by Ruby, Perl and good old PHP.
